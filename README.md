After logging in, jwt is generated for the user, and the user is redirected to home page.
Since the main functionallity of this app is to predict whether the price is going up or down, user has to follow (add) some stocks first. 
Unfortunately because of the free version of the external API I had to limit the stock per user to 3.

So the user clicks on 'Manage my stocks'

The user starts typing the company name, and the stock will be shown:

After adding, the stock is displayed, and the user can see the graph of the prices

After that, the user can go to 'News Feed' to see all of the latest news for the stocks he's following, along with the overall sentiment.

Then the user can go to 'My Stocks' where the newest price is shown, 
along with options like: Predict, Train and Evaluate, since the training part is done automatically after the user adds the stock, 
we'll try the Predict and Evaluate option. (Of course the user is able to re-train the model after some time with more fresh data)
